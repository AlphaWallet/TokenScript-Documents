    <title>Guide: Build websites around attestations</title>
    <body>
        <p>We will use Devcon ticket as an example and build a few websites around it.</p>
        <section id="section_zrr_stx_vnb">
            <title>Build the issuer website</title>
            <p>This website is the issuer website of the ticket attestation. A Devcon ticket are
                sent to the users in the form of a <xref href="../MagicLink.dita"/>: a link that
                contains some cryptographic attestations. In this case, the cryptographic
                attestation is the ticket.</p>
            <p>This issuer website serves to display the ticket's view, called <xref
                    href="../TokenCard.dita"/>, so anyone who owns a ticket attestation can see
                what's in the ticket - such as ticket's number (represented by â„–). It also stores
                the ticket attestation in its cookie so that when other 3rd party websites wants
                integrate they can talk to this website.</p>
            <p>Create an HTML page like this:
                <codeblock><coderef href="isssuer-site.html" format="html"/></codeblock></p>
            <p>Serve it on a web server then you should see something like this:</p>
            <p><image href="issuer-site.svg"/></p>
            <note audience="implementer"> Aliaksei suggested to utilise frameworks such as RxJS here
                and it's apparent that a framework is needed since the demonstration code wouldn't
                be able to handle renegotiation or added new tokens. I'll leave that to mid-level
                architecting and for now the psuedo code is only to demonstrate design concept.
